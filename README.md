I am an italian girl who has decided to change her career path from SALES ASSISTANT to Front-end developer.<br>
I studied my first self-taught languages (HTML - CSS) during the onset of covid in 2020 while many activities (also my recent job) were closed.<br>
In 2022 I decide to follow a course where to learn and deepen my knowledge to be, a day, a FE developer.

I love play online ðŸŽ®, in particulary I play League of legends and Valorant, and collect LEGO.
